> or anyone for that matter 

Initial Setup - 

- Connect your phone(or any other test device) and your PC to same wifi network. 
- Change the `host` variable from loopback 127.0.0.1 to your WLAN Adapter Wifi IPv4 Address.
- Run the server

Getting HI - 

- Open the test device(on the same network), and enter this as a URL in your web browser - host:port
- These `host` and `port` are your WLAN IPv4 and Port Number defined in the server. 
- When you go to the `host:port`, your running server will say you Hi!
